# Home-Automation
Control Your Lights and Fans and any other Appliance Simply by your IOS/Andriod
In this project, I developed a home automation system that allowed remote control of AC-powered appliances like lights and fans overWi-Fi. Using an ESP8266 wifi Module microcontroller
I programmed the device to connect to a Wi-Fi network and respond to usercommands sent through a mobile app or web interface.
I used relays to switch the AC mains power to the appliances safely, ensuringisolation between the low-voltage control circuit and the high-voltage AC lines. 
The device was housed in a protective enclosure, andproper safety measures were followed while wiring the AC connections.

Required components for this WiFi relay module:
1. NodeMCU board
2. Relay Module 5volt
3. 5 volt DC supply
